# Enhanced Device Modal Integration

## Summary of Changes

We've consolidated the device modal system to use a single `UnifiedDeviceModal` component that supports both solo and collaborative modes, instead of having separate modal components for each mode.

## Key Improvements:

1. **Streamlined Architecture**: 
   - Removed the need for separate `CollaborativeDeviceModal` component
   - Enhanced `UnifiedDeviceModal` to handle both solo and collaborative editing modes

2. **Collaboration Features Integration**:
   - Device locking mechanism for collaborative editing
   - Real-time typing indicators
   - Cursor position sharing
   - Collaboration status indicators
   - Auto-saving of collaborative changes

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Updated imports in all dependent files
   - Created a centralized `CollaborationUI.js` in the main components directory
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing code

4. **Benefits**:
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Simplified maintenance
   - Consistent user experience across solo and collaborative modes
   - Easier future enhancements with single point of implementation

## Modified Files:

- `src/app/components/UnifiedDeviceModal.js` - Enhanced with collaboration features
- `src/app/components/UnifiedDeviceModalAdapter.js` - Updated to use enhanced modal for both modes
- `src/app/components/CollaborationUI.js` - Created from collaboration UI components
- `src/app/networkscan/components/SharedScansBrowser.js` - Updated imports and rendering logic
- `src/app/networkscan/components/networkdashboard.js` - Removed CollaborativeDeviceModal dependency

## Legacy Files (Can be removed in future cleanup):

- `src/app/components/collaboration/CollaborativeDeviceModal.js`
- `src/app/components/collaboration/CollaborationUI.js`

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Test device editing in solo mode
2. Test device editing in collaborative mode with multiple users
3. Verify locking and unlocking functionality
4. Verify typing indicators and cursor positions
5. Test real-time updates between multiple users
