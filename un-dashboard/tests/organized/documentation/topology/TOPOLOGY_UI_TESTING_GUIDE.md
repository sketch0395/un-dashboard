### 7. Performance & Responsiveness
- [ ] **Load Time**: Topology renders quickly
- [ ] **Interactions**: Smooth hover/click responses
- [ ] **Layout Changes**: Fast transitions
- [ ] **No Errors**: Console free of JavaScript errors

## üîß Troubleshooting Steps

### If Page Shows "No Scans Found":
1. Check if scan data was created: Run `node check-scan-history.js`
2. Verify authentication: Check login-data.json timestamp
3. Refresh the page or clear browser cache

### If Topology Doesn't Render:
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify API calls in Network tab
4. Check if scan data has proper device connections

### If Authentication Issues:
1. Run: `node refresh-auth-token.js`
2. Reload the page
3. Check if redirected to login page

## üéâ SUCCESS CRITERIA
‚úÖ **TOPOLOGY TESTING COMPLETE** when:
- Both circular and hierarchical layouts display correctly
- All 8 test devices are visible and positioned properly
- Device connections show the gateway-switch-device hierarchy
- Interactive features (hover, click, tooltips) work smoothly
- Network relationships match our test data structure
- No console errors or performance issues

## üìù Current Testing Session
**Started**: ${new Date().toISOString()}
**Test Data**: Full Network Topology Test (8 devices)
**Browser**: VS Code Simple Browser at http://localhost:3001/networkscan
