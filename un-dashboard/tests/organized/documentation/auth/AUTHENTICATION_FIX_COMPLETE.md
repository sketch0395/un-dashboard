# üéâ Authentication Fix Complete - Scan Rename 401 Error Resolved

## Summary
The 401 "Unauthorized" error in the scan rename functionality has been **SUCCESSFULLY FIXED** by updating the authentication validation pattern in the scan-specific API routes.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was an **authentication validation inconsistency** between different API routes:
- ‚úÖ **Main scan-history route** (`/api/scan-history/route.js`) was updated to use: `if (!authData || !authData.user)`
- ‚ùå **Individual scan route** (`/api/scan-history/[scanId]/route.js`) was still using: `if (!authData.success)`

Since the `AuthService.verifyAuth()` method returns `{ user, sessionId }` (not `{ success, user }`), the old validation pattern was always failing.

## Fix Applied
Updated the authentication validation in **all three methods** (GET, PUT, DELETE) in `/api/scan-history/[scanId]/route.js`:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
const authData = await AuthService.verifyAuth(mockReq);
if (!authData.success) {  // ‚ùå authData.success doesn't exist
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const authData = await AuthService.verifyAuth(mockReq);
if (!authData || !authData.user) {  // ‚úÖ Correct validation
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

## Files Modified
1. **`src/app/api/scan-history/[scanId]/route.js`**
   - Fixed GET method authentication validation
   - Fixed PUT method authentication validation (scan rename)
   - Fixed DELETE method authentication validation

## Verification Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Syntax Check**: No TypeScript/ESLint errors
2. ‚úÖ **Build Check**: Next.js builds successfully
3. ‚úÖ **Module Resolution**: No import/path errors
4. ‚úÖ **Runtime Check**: Development server starts without errors

## Expected Behavior Now
- ‚úÖ **Authenticated users**: Can rename scans without 401 errors
- ‚úÖ **Unauthenticated users**: Still get 401 (as expected)
- ‚úÖ **Invalid scan IDs**: Get 404 "Scan not found" (as expected)
- ‚úÖ **Malformed requests**: Get 400 "Bad Request" (as expected)

## Testing
Use these test files to verify the fix:
- `public/test-scan-rename-complete.html` - Comprehensive testing interface
- `test-auth-fix-verification.js` - Node.js verification script

## Next Steps
1. **Verify with real data**: Test with actual scan data from the database
2. **End-to-end testing**: Test the full user workflow from scan creation to rename
3. **Monitor logs**: Check for any remaining authentication issues

## Technical Notes
- The `AuthService.verifyAuth()` method correctly checks both cookies and Authorization headers
- The enhanced cookie handling was already implemented in previous fixes
- This fix ensures consistency across all scan-related API endpoints

---
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - The 401 authentication error for scan renaming has been resolved.
