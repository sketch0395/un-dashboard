# Device Management Page

The Device Management page provides a comprehensive interface for managing and organizing all network devices discovered through network scans. This centralized management system allows users to categorize, configure, and monitor devices across their network infrastructure.

## Features

### üìä Device Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Devices**: Overview of all managed devices
- **Online/Offline Status**: Real-time connectivity status with percentage breakdown
- **Network Roles**: Count of gateways, switches, and regular devices
- **Category Distribution**: Visual breakdown of device categories

### üîç Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Search**: Find devices by name, IP address, hostname, or vendor
- **Category Filter**: Filter by device categories (Production Server, Router, Switch, etc.)
- **Network Role Filter**: Filter by Gateway, Switch, or Regular Device
- **Status Filter**: Show only Online or Offline devices
- **Sorting**: Sort by name, IP, category, role, status, or last seen

### üìã Device List Features
- **Comprehensive Device Info**: Shows IP, hostname, vendor, MAC address, latency
- **Network Hierarchy**: Displays parent-child relationships (gateway/switch connections)
- **Status Indicators**: Visual online/offline status with appropriate icons
- **Notes Support**: Indicates devices with attached notes
- **Open Ports**: Shows count of discovered open ports
- **Last Seen**: Timestamp of last network scan detection

### ‚ö° Bulk Operations
- **Multi-Select**: Select multiple devices for batch operations
- **Bulk Category Assignment**: Set categories for multiple devices at once
- **Bulk Role Assignment**: Assign network roles to multiple devices
- **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple devices from management

### üîß Device Configuration
- **Unified Device Modal**: Comprehensive device editing interface (reuses existing UnifiedDeviceModal)
- **Network Role Assignment**: Configure devices as Gateways, Switches, or Regular Devices
- **Category Management**: Assign devices to predefined categories
- **Network Topology**: Configure parent-child relationships between network devices
- **Notes Management**: Add, edit, and delete device-specific notes
- **Change History**: Track all modifications made to device properties

## Integration

### Data Sources
- **Network Scan Data**: Automatically imports devices from network scan results
- **Device Properties**: Integrates with existing `customDeviceProperties` localStorage
- **Scan History**: Uses latest scan data for connectivity status and device information

### Existing Components
- **UnifiedDeviceModal**: Reuses the comprehensive device editing modal
- **Device Management Utils**: Leverages existing utility functions for device property management
- **Navbar Integration**: Added navigation button to access the Device Management page

## Navigation

The Device Management page is accessible through:
- Navbar button: "Device Management"
- Direct URL: `/device-management`

- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms

## Usage Workflow

1. **View Overview**: Check device statistics for network health overview
2. **Filter/Search**: Use controls to find specific devices or device types
3. **Select Devices**: Use checkboxes to select devices for bulk operations
4. **Edit Individual Devices**: Click "Edit" button to configure specific devices
5. **Bulk Operations**: Use bulk controls to update multiple devices simultaneously
6. **Monitor Status**: Track online/offline status and network relationships

This comprehensive device management system provides network administrators with the tools needed to effectively organize, configure, and monitor their network infrastructure from a single interface.
